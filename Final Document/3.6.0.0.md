## 3.6 Design Constraints

Standards of compliance for FERPA, ADA, and BYU-Idaho must be met by the Student Calendar application. The FERPA standards will place constraints on how data may be transferred between the application and I-learn. ADA standards will require added functionality, such as voice recognition, so that disabled students may use the application. The Student Calendar system design must work with the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox web browsers. The user will be required to have an web browser to access the application.
