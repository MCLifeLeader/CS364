## 1.2 Scope of Project

The scope of this project will be the creation of a multi-platform calendar program. The program will be capable of interfacing with the BYU-I I-Learn system. In addition to the features and functionality of a standard calendar program, this program will allow BYU-I students to create events, reminders, or to do lists based off due dates from their I-Learn page. For a more detailed explanation of individual program features see section 2.2.
