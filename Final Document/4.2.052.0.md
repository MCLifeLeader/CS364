#### 4.2.52.1 Custom Videos

We will use several custom videos to verify that users can use their own custom videos.  Testers will verify that custom videos can be uploaded to the app and that they recieve the appropriate prompts.  Testers will also ensure that these videos display properly within the app.  An error message will be displayed if the user hasn't granted the proper permissions for the app to use their camera.  An error message will be displayed if there is not connectivity and the video is unable to upload.  An error message will display if the video fails to play properly within the app.
