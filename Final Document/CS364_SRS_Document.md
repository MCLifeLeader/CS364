## 2.1 Product Perspective

The Student Calendar can be used as a stand-alone application that gives students all of the functionality as described in the product functions section. For BYU-I students, the calendar's main benefits come from interfacing with the University's I-Learn system allowing them to access assignments and other events. Interfaces to other external systems will provide further functionality outside of basic calendar tasks. Detailed descriptions of these external systems are beyond the scope of this document. All interfacing with external systems will be done according to industry standards.</br>

## 2.8 Assumptions and Dependencies

### 2.8.1 - Assumptions

#### 2.8.1.1 Assumption 1

An assumption made is that the devices that access the application will have the requisite hardware resources to properly access the content.

#### 2.8.1.2 Assumption 2

The student calendar requirements highlight optional features that are not critical to the function of the application. They consist of various improvements to usability and convenience and may or may not be added after the development of the core features based on the discretion of the stakeholders.

#### 2.8.1.3 Assumption 3

Concerning the security of the application API, it is assumed that the necessary identification and authentication is in place for users who wish to access the API.

#### 2.8.1.4 Assumption 4

In order for the calendar application to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act any device using the speech recognition and speech to text features of the application are assumed to have the hardware and software capabilities to do so.

#### 2.8.1.5 Assumption 5

It is assumed that the messaging feature, including text messages, will incorporate PHP's mail function and a list of mobile carrier's email servers to function.

#### 2.8.1.6 Assumption 6

It is assumed that the calendar application will adhere to FERPA law in the same manner that I-Learn does for the protection and privacy of student education records.

#### 2.8.1.7 Assumption 7

For the purpose of setting time zones for the calendar application it is assumed that the application's time zone will use the device's current time zone setting.

#### 2.8.1.8 Assumption 8

There is an assumption that the active student directory will be used simply for look-up and then contacting of students. LDAP is relatively slower with add, delete, and update, but quicker through simple reads or queries.

#### 2.8.1.9 Assumption 9
The Student Calendar App assumes the student is a student at Brigham Young University - Idaho who uses I-Learn 3.0.

#### 2.8.1.10 Assumption 10
It is assumed that the student is in possession of their Brigham Young University - Idaho username and password in order to gain access to the application.

#### 2.8.1.11 Assumption 11
It is assumed that the student is using the application on a device that supports color in order to view certain features.

### 2.8.2 - Dependencies

#### 2.8.2.1 Dependency 1

Some of the application's features are dependent on hardware components that are more commonly found in mobile handsets. For example, the video calling integration would depend on a physical camera and the travel-time indicator will benefit from the inclusion of a GPS antenna.

#### 2.8.2.2 Dependency 2

Several features in this document will depend wholly on the existence and maintenance of various APIs.  

#### 2.8.2.3 Dependency 3

The application will depend on mobile devices which will include the necessary mobile internet browsers (i.e. Chrome, Safari) to accommodate the mobile form factor of the application in those environments.

#### 2.8.2.4 Dependency 4

The incorporation and usability of the calendar application API depends on runnable code contained within documentation to help and encourage developers to add functionality and interactivity.

#### 2.8.2.5 Dependency 5

Successful syncing of the application with BYU-Idaho's I-Learn is dependent on a user's ability to login as a currently admitted student and the condition of the user's current enrollment in the classes they wish to sync.

#### 2.8.2.6 Dependency 6

Uploading of images will depend on the functionality of Google's Cloud Vision API to detect inappropriate content. Requests to bypass this filtering must be resolved with a site administrator.

#### 2.8.2.7 Dependency 7

Push notifications will rely on Google Cloud Messaging for Chrome and Android users.  They will rely on Apple Push Notification service for macOS and iOS devices.

#### 2.8.2.8 Dependency 8

The Student Calendar Application requires the student be an active enrolled student at Brigham Young University - Idaho.

#### 2.8.2.9 Dependency 9

The Student Calendar Application replies upon the Facebook, Google Plus, and Twitter services for sharing students calendar information.

## 3.3 Usability Requirements

The Student calendar must be uniform in its appearance and functionality to improve learnability for the user. This will be accomplished through the following criteria:

* Simple GUI
* Navigation
* Tutorial
* ADA

### 3.3.1 Simple GUI

The application will have large functional icons visible to the user whenever they are viewing the Main or daily calendar pages.

The process of adding, removing, and modifying events should require similar steps to make easy to remember and perform those actions.

### 3.3.2 Navigation

The Student Calendar will be able to move from each view to another with no more than one click.

Each window must feature a close 'X' icon to make it simple for the user to cancel any action and return to the previous view

### 3.3.3 Tutorial

New Users will be introduced to the Student Calendar functionality through tutorial message windows.

The application will offer a help menu that the user may select to learn how to find commonly used features.

## 3.4 Performance Requirements

These performance metrics are dependant upon the user having a stable and reliable Internet connection.

The Student Calendar must be interactive with delays in action-response functionality kept to a minimum. When opening window forms or displaying error messages, the delay should be less than 5 seconds. When accessing the user account database, the operation of opening user preferences, sorting user items, and displaying the user calendar will be performed under 5 seconds. Time to Connect to the server will be based on the distance between the user's machine and the server but the application will determine if the connection is successful within 20 seconds.

## 3.5 Logical Database Requirements

There are three data entities involved with the application and the user account database: Calendar Assignments, Calendar Events, and Users. These entities and the information associated with them will be stored in their respective relational tables on the web server. The following is a brief classification of each of these entities and their attributes:

[EDITORS / AUTHORS: We are not attempting to define or create the database and tables. We need to describe the kinds of data that will be required in the schema. More high level. Include type and limitations of the kinds of data to be used. This should not look like database schema.]

The phone number must contain at least 10 digits. <li/>User login name - This is a text field for the user's name used to log in to the system.<li/>User password - This is a text field that contains the user's login password. It must contain an uppercase character and a number.<ul/> |The User data are the collection of information pertaining to each user including group memberships and contact information.|

## 3.6 Design Constraints

[EDITORS / AUTHORS: Look at what the document says about design constrains in IEEE document. pg: 60]

Standards of compliance for FERPA, ADA, and BYU-Idaho must be met by the Student Calendar application. The FERPA standards will place constraints on how data may be transferred between the application and I-learn. ADA standards will require added functionality, such as voice recognition, so that disabled students may use the application. The Student Calendar system design must work with the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox web browsers. The user will be required to have an web browser to access the application.

## 3.7 Software System Attributes

### 3.7.1 Availability

The Student Calendar should be available to users twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week unless the software is undergoing scheduled maintenance.

### 3.7.2 Correctness

The Student Calendar must display all user assignments and events in their correct times and dates. User groups must display correct contact information.

### 3.7.3 Maintainability

Developers shall be able to be maintain and update the system after its initial release. Modifications should be able to be made while the system is live. Major changes shall require scheduled maintenance and the application will not be accessible to users. Maintenance notices must be sent to all users at least two days prior to going offline.

### 3.7.4 Security

The systems security requirements shall conform to FERPA standards.

### 3.7.5 Data Integerty

[How the data is protected and kept clean. How it's maintained. Crash conditions. Bad data entered. Bad data from external sources.]

# 4.0 Verification
